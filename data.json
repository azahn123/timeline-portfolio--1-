All major anatomical regions are covered from a combined lecture and dissection approach. Dissection sessions provide each student with an opportunity to verify all that he or she has been exposed to via reading and lecture regarding the gross structure of the human body, i.e., evidence-based medicine in its simplest form. The sequence in which the regions are approached are as follows: back, upper limb, thorax, abdomen, pelvis and perineum, lower limb, and head and neck.",
